           <!--This is the format for comments. Also this body section
               is where you will put the form tag stuff. Also when you're
               looking into the form tag remember our method is going to 
               equal post and our action will equal whatever you name the
               output php file. (Make sure the output is a php file.)
               Other notes: Your output page will have this exact same 
               format. The only difference is you will embed php here in 
               these <body> tags. That means do the <?php ... ?> 
               like you did for the classes. And don't forget to 
               include our classes.php inside the php tags like the link
               I sent you tells you to do. If you have any questions ask me.-->
